In [a previous post](/2024-10-22-nier-automata-first-view), I ranted a bit about the first playthrough of the [NieR: Automata](https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/) game.
I speculated if I want to spend more time with the game.
In the end, I promised I will give it a go.
It was not my top priority though as in the meantime I did try other games, finished [Bioshock: Infinite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/8870/BioShock_Infinite/) with Half-Life 2 Episode 1.
Two and half month and 11 in-game hours later, the ending B of Nier: Automata is conquered!

So what to write about it.
It is still a little bit too Japanese for me.
The story has unfolded, but not as much as I would expect (there was one interesting plot-twist. It reminded me of the [Oblivion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/) movie).
I enjoyed the "katanas" part of the game, the hacking mini-games not so much.

I do think Nier is different from other games.
It is not just run'n'gun, but someone has thought about the script, and it is serving you the story bit by bit.
Even side-quests reveal the story.
In some way, it is more of an artwork then other games, I would say.

I am still thinking about why I am not as excited about the game as everybody else.
It might be because I don't care that much for the story as the main characters, who on the other hand care too much.
This time I am convinced I will finish all other story-relevant ending.

Sorry I am that negative about the game, I don't know how to articulate it better :).
I should probably write more.
