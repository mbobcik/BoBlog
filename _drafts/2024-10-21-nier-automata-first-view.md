I recently finished first playthrough of the [NieR: Automata](https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/) game.
It was recomended to me in some YouTube video I dont really remember, but it said I will really appreciate the game. And that I definitely have to replay it again after I finish it once.

So here I am, 14 hours of dad life in, on the brink of replaying, and really unsure if I enjoyed the first ride.

To articulate my feeling I tried to open [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/nier-automata/) curious if I find some same feelers. Among numerous "ten-out-of-tens" I did find few. 

> A good game, but VERY overrated. While polished and enjoyable, has many flaws. Huge lack of enemy variety, too few bosses, combat is clean but gets repetitive, the story is predictable if you are not under 14yo, and I couldn't care for any of the main characters. ...
